Assignment Description of Codes
#include <iostream>: Including the iostream Library

This line is a preprocessor directive that includes the iostream library in the program.

The iostream library provides functionality for input and output operations, such as reading from the keyboard (cin) and writing to the console (cout).

Without this line, the program cannot perform basic input/output operations.

using namespace std;: Using the Standard Namespace

This line tells the compiler to use the std (standard) namespace, which contains standard C++ library components like cout, cin, endl, etc.

Namespaces help avoid naming conflicts by grouping related names together.

By using using namespace std;, you can directly use cout and cin instead of writing std::cout and std::cin.

Note: In larger programs, itâ€™s often better to avoid using namespace std; and instead use std:: explicitly to prevent potential naming conflicts.

int main(): The Main Function

Every C++ program must have a main() function. It is the entry point of the program, meaning execution starts here.

The int before main() indicates that the function returns an integer value to the operating system upon completion.

The parentheses () after main indicate that it is a function.

The body of the main() function is enclosed in curly braces {}.

cout <<: Displaying Output with cout

cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object of the ostream class, defined in the iostream library.

It is used to display output on the console.

The << operator is called the insertion operator, and it sends data to the output stream.

Example: cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;

"Hello, World!" is the string to be displayed.

endl (end line) inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.

cin >> ...;: Getting Input with cin

cin (pronounced "see-in") is an object of the istream class, defined in the iostream library.

It is used to read input from the user via the keyboard.

The >> operator is called the extraction operator, and it extracts data from the input stream.

Example: cin >> variableName;

The input value is stored in variableName.

Ensure the variable type matches the input type (e.g., int, float, string).

return 0;: Returning from main

The return 0; statement at the end of the main() function indicates that the program has executed successfully.

By convention, a return value of 0 signifies success, while non-zero values indicate errors or abnormal termination.

This value is returned to the operating system.

Additional Key Points
Comments in C++

Comments are used to explain code and improve readability. They are ignored by the compiler.

Single-line comments: // This is a single-line comment

Multi-line comments: /* This is a multi-line comment */

Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data in memory.

Common data types include:

int for integers (e.g., int age = 25;)

float and double for floating-point numbers (e.g., double price = 19.99;)

char for single characters (e.g., char grade = 'A';)

string for text (e.g., string name = "Alice";)

Variables must be declared before use.

Basic Syntax Rules

Each statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (;).

Code blocks are enclosed in curly braces {}.

Indentation and spacing are not mandatory but improve readability.
